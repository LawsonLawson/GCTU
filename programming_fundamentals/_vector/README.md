# BMC - Working with VECTOR instead of Generic ARRAY

## A self experimentation of working with ``<VECTOR>``

## Objective
I have to be reading about Arrays in C++ which led me to <vector> .. I am now more insterested in what I can do with it.

## Compiling:
Program will be compiled this way:

```
 g++ -pedantic *.cpp header.h -o obj_code
```
